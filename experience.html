        During my time at Altus Group, I worked across different departments to
        gain experience in a variety of disciplines. Most of my experience was
        in the Local Taxation team. This involved up to 10 site visits per week,
        where I surveyed commercial properties and provided advice on business
        rates to the 1,400+ clients within my caseload. Maintaining regular
        communication with clients was essential throughout their business rates
        review. I was also trusted with providing software and on-site training
        for new graduates and placement students.
