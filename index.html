      <p class="profile-info">
        I left the UK in February 2023 to begin travelling full-time. Taking
        this risk has allowed me to have experiences and opportunities I would
        otherwise not have had. Whilst travelling, I am enjoying exploring the
        world and having the opportunity to be introduced to new cultures. Solo
        travel has pushed me out of my comfort zone in many ways, but it has
        also proven that I can adapt to new situations quickly.
        <br /><br />
        I arrived in Australia on 06.05.2023 on a Working Holiday Visa (subclass
        417). I have now completed the required regional work to attain my
        second-year visa.
        <br /><br />
        Over the years, I have gained a great deal of customer service
        experience. I am a very sociable person who enjoys meeting new people
        and undertaking new challenges. I can learn quickly, and my high level
        of self-motivation means that I will adopt and learn the practice of
        your business quickly. I naturally have good organisational skills and I
        always strive to achieve the highest possible standard in everything I
        do. These qualities have been beneficial when trying to juggle work and
        hobbies. I am an effective team member, but I am equally capable of
        working with confidence on my own.
