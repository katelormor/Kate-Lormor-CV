             I left the UK in February 2023 to begin travelling full-time. Taking this risk has allowed me to have experiences and opportunities I would otherwise not have had. Whilst travelling, I am enjoying exploring the world and having the opportunity to be introduced to new cultures. Solo travel has pushed me out of my comfort zone in many ways, but it has also proven that I can adapt to new situations quickly.
<br /><br />
I arrived in Australia in May 2023 on a Working Holiday Visa (subclass 417). I have now completed the required regional work to attain my second-year visa. WHCIH I WILL APPLY FOR SHORTLY. 
<br /><br/>
Over the years, I have gained a great deal of customer service experience. I am a very sociable person who enjoys meeting new people and undertaking new challenges. I can learn quickly, and my high level of self-motivation means that I will adopt and learn the practice of your business quickly. I naturally have good organisational skills and I always strive to achieve the highest possible standard in everything I do. These qualities have been beneficial when trying to juggle work, hobbies and studies. I am an effective team member, but I am equally capable of working with confidence on my own.
<br/><br/>
During 2022 the company I was working for was designing and building a completely new internal system using Microsoft Dynamics 365. I was not a part of the design team, but I was involved in the testing phases. This mainly involved testing the prototype to identify any bugs to remove and any improvements to be added in the next version. This testing process went on for months before the finished system was released to select teams within the company. 

….This was what sparked my interest & just like any millennial I get pulled in by one or two of the more persistent Instagram ads. Eventually I signed up for the free one hour introduction to coding course by SheCodes. 
…then signed up for basic
…after that I was committed, so I wanted to learn the fundamentals of all things coding so I signed up for their full “Max” course and the rest as they say is history… or in real life can be found on my projects page.
